# Linodeius

This is a Node.js client for Linode's API.

**This is a work in progress.**

## Installation

As with any NPM package:

    npm install linodeius

For use in an application:

    const Linode = require('linodeius');
    const api = new Linode(api_key);

    api.linode.list().then(function(linodes) {
      // Use linodes data.
    });

## Configuration

The API key can be specified in a number of locations:

 * The `api_key` argument to `new Linode()`.
 * The `LINODE_API_KEY` environment variable which specifies the key.
 * The `LINODE_API_KEY_FILE` environment variable which specifies a path to
   a file containing the key.
 * A `.linode-key` file in the same directory as this package.
 * A `.linode-key` file in the user's home directory.

The key used to make an API call is dependent on those factors evaluated in
that order of priority.

## TODO

* Add support for batch operations via the `api_action=batch` mode.
